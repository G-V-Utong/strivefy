## Architecture 
![architecture](https://github.com/G-V-Utong/strivefy/blob/main/client/public/images/Simple%20architecture.PNG)

Users can communicate with the task management application by using its REST APIs. The client-side is able to communicate with the server-side due to Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS). When a user makes a request (sign up, sign in, add a task etc), information is dispatched to the server by Redux Dispatch.

## Models
![Models](https://github.com/G-V-Utong/strivefy/blob/main/client/public/images/Models.PNG)

The database has two models: user and task, with a one-to-many relationship.

## Infrastructure

- Branching and Merging: Use the GitHub flow for version control and collaboration among team members.
- Deployment Strategy: With CI/CD to deploy the frontend and backend on GitHub Pages/ Netlify or Vercel.
- Data Population: Integrate a database for persistent storage with Node.js MongoDB.
- Testing: Implement Node.js unit testing for backend functionality and manual testing for the frontend user interface.
