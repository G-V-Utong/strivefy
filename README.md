## Background

### Overview
Strivefy is a robust and intuitive task management application designed to streamline productivity and enhance collaboration. Tailored for individuals, Strivefy provides a seamless and efficient solution for organizing tasks, and achieving goals.

With a user-centric approach, Strivefy prioritizes simplicity without compromising functionality. The application empowers users to effortlessly create, assign, and track tasks, fostering a clear and structured workflow. Key features include a dynamic task dashboard, customizable priority settings, real-time collaboration tools, and insightful progress tracking. Strivefy leverages technologies, including NextJs, ReactJs, and Redux, to deliver a responsive and seamless user experience across web and mobile platforms.

### Motivation
The primary motivations or choosing this project were to finally master combining backend and frontend technology to create a functional application, and to be able to master CRUD functionalities. The task management application was the easiest project to achieve these two goals.

### Target Audience
The application is targeted at solo users who want to simply organize their tasks and have them in one place. It comes with a dashboard that tracks tasks and give users real-time information about their progress.

### Technology Stack
#### Front-end
- Libraries: React
- Languages: HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript
- Platforms: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Frameworks: React
- State Management library: Redux
#### Back-End
- Language: JavaScript
- Runtime Environment: NodeJs
- Framework: ExpressJs
#### Database
- MongoDB
- library: Mongoose
## Architecture 
![architecture](https://github.com/G-V-Utong/strivefy/blob/main/client/public/images/Simple%20architecture.PNG)

Users can communicate with the task management application by using its REST APIs. The client-side is able to communicate with the server-side due to Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS). When a user makes a request (sign up, sign in, add a task etc), information is dispatched to the server by Redux Dispatch.

## Models
![Models](https://github.com/G-V-Utong/strivefy/blob/main/client/public/images/Models.PNG)

The database has two models: user and task, with a one-to-many relationship.
